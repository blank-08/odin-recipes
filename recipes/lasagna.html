        <h2>What is Lasagna?</h2>
        <p>A <em>sumptuous masterpiece of Italian cuisine,</em> lasagna is a layered delight that enchants both the eyes and the palate with its rich symphony of flavors and textures. At its heart lies al dente sheets of pasta, meticulously layered with a velvety blanket of creamy béchamel sauce and tangy marinara, each stratum infusing the dish with its distinct essence. Between these tender layers nestles a savory medley of ingredients—succulent ground meats, vibrant sautéed vegetables, and creamy ricotta cheese—each adding depth and character to the ensemble. Crowned with a generous mantle of gooey melted mozzarella, the lasagna emerges from the oven with a golden crust, its aroma wafting through the air, beckoning all to the table. With each forkful, one experiences a symphony of flavors: the comforting richness of the sauce, the satisfying bite of the pasta, and the melty decadence of the cheeses, all woven together in a harmonious tapestry of culinary bliss. A slice of lasagna is not just a dish; it is an invitation to savor the warmth and comfort of a home-cooked meal, a celebration of tradition, love, and the simple pleasures of hearty Italian fare.

            <ol>
                <li><p><strong>Prep Ingredients:</strong> Prepare your ingredients, including cooking any meat, sautéing vegetables, and making sauces. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</p></li>
