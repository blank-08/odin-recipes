        <h2>Steps on how to cook steak</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Remove the steak from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature. This ensures more even cooking. Pat the steak dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture, which helps in achieving a better sear.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Seasoning:</strong> Generously season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper. Optionally, you can add any desired spices or herbs for extra flavor.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Cooking:</strong> Heat a skillet or grill over high heat until it's very hot. Add a small amount of oil or butter to the pan just before adding the steak to prevent sticking. Carefully place the steak in the pan and let it cook without moving for a few minutes to develop a crust. Flip the steak and cook for an additional few minutes, depending on your desired level of doneness (use a meat thermometer for accuracy: 120°F for rare, 130°F for medium-rare, 140°F for medium, 150°F for medium-well, and 160°F for well-done)</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Resting:</strong> Once cooked to your liking, remove the steak from the pan and transfer it to a plate. Allow the steak to rest for about 5-10 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a juicier steak.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Serving:</strong> After resting, slice the steak against the grain for maximum tenderness and serve hot. Optionally, you can garnish with fresh herbs or a pat of butter for added flavor and presentation.</p></li>
            </ol>
